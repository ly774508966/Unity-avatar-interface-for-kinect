# Unity-avatar-interface-for-kinect

Avatar imported as an asset in Unity mimics movements of the user.
The joint locations are captured by using a Kinect (1st Gen).
This project was part of a larger effort to use joint-tracking for providing haptic feedback.
Applications include but are not limited to post-stroke rehabilitation and posture correction.
